I would like to thank the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) administration and staff for the admission into its highly competitive programme, hospitality, and student care during my two years stay at the Institute. I would like to thank the Western Indian Ocean Regional Initiative in Marine Sciences and Education (WIORISE) for the financial support of this study through to its completion. I am extremely grateful for the assistance, generosity, and advice from my supervisors Dr. Margareth S. Kyewalyanga and Dr. Yohana W. Shaghude; your guidance throughout this thesis has been a great value that has continually stimulated my analytical thinking and greatly assisted my scientific writing. I also owe a special note of gratitude to Technicians; Mr. Mtumwa Mwadini for his assistance during the field and laboratory work at Zanzibar and Pangani; Dr. Mohammed Maalim Kombo and Ms Khayrat Ubwa for their significant help on the technical aspects especially the procedures at the IMS laboratory. The assistance of the boatmen, Mohammed at Zanzibar and Ramadhan at Pangani, is also appreciated. I would like to extend many thanks to all IMS students and all other friends, communities at the study area who provided their contributions, advice, or support throughout the work of this Thesis. The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (NEODAAS) and Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) are greatly acknowledged for providing the satellite data which was among the major components of this study. Lastly, I would like to thank the Almighty God for what he has done to me since the beginning of this study until now.

# Abstract {-}
Phytoplankton are important in aquatic ecosystems since they are the primary producers. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is used as a proxy in estimation of phytoplankton biomass. The present study was conducted to determine the spatial and temporal phytoplankton distribution and abundance in relation to the physico-chemical variables using remote sensing Chl-a and in situ collected Chl-a measurements along Zanzibar and Pemba channels. In situ Chl-a was based on fluorometric method while the satellite 
Chl-a was acquired from MODIS sensor. There was a significant difference in Chl-a (H=66.23, 11 d.f, p<0.05) and SST (H =244.27, 11 d.f, p<0.05) variation between the months, with higher Chl-a concentration in April-May and July-August. High Chl-a concentration were observed on the nearshore waters at both Zanzibar and Pemba channels. The rainy season was having significantly higher Chl-a concentration than the dry season (U=19, 1d.f., p=9.15×10-21) with the mean values above 0.31mg/m3 and below 0.06mg/m3 respectively. Spatially, the Zanzibar channel had significantly higher Chl-a concentration than the Pemba channel (F3, 116=16.96, p=3.36×10-9). The Chl-a was positively correlated with nitrate, phosphate, DO and pH and negatively correlated with SST and salinity during the dry and rainy seasons. The satellite Chl-a was positively and significantly correlated with in situ Chl-a for the rainy (r = 0.86, p < 0.05) and the dry (r = 0.74, p < 0.05) season. However, satellite Chl-a was significantly higher than the in situ values. The present study revealed that phytoplankton distribution and abundance at the sampled sites was influenced by nitrate and phosphate in the dry season and nitrate and salinity during the rainy season.
