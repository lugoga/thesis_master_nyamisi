["abstract.html", "Abstract", " Abstract Phytoplankton are important in aquatic ecosystems since they are the primary producers. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is used as a proxy in estimation of phytoplankton biomass. The present study was conducted to determine the spatial and temporal phytoplankton distribution and abundance in relation to the physico-chemical variables using remote sensing Chl-a and in situ collected Chl-a measurements along Zanzibar and Pemba channels. In situ Chl-a was based on fluorometric method while the satellite Chl-a was acquired from MODIS sensor. There was a significant difference in Chl-a (H=66.23, 11 d.f, p&lt;0.05) and SST (H =244.27, 11 d.f, p&lt;0.05) variation between the months, with higher Chl-a concentration in April-May and July-August. High Chl-a concentration were observed on the nearshore waters at both Zanzibar and Pemba channels. The rainy season was having significantly higher Chl-a concentration than the dry season (U=19, 1d.f., p=9.15×10-21) with the mean values above 0.31mg/m3 and below 0.06mg/m3 respectively. Spatially, the Zanzibar channel had significantly higher Chl-a concentration than the Pemba channel (F3, 116=16.96, p=3.36×10-9). The Chl-a was positively correlated with nitrate, phosphate, DO and pH and negatively correlated with SST and salinity during the dry and rainy seasons. The satellite Chl-a was positively and significantly correlated with in situ Chl-a for the rainy (r = 0.86, p &lt; 0.05) and the dry (r = 0.74, p &lt; 0.05) season. However, satellite Chl-a was significantly higher than the in situ values. The present study revealed that phytoplankton distribution and abundance at the sampled sites was influenced by nitrate and phosphate in the dry season and nitrate and salinity during the rainy season.

["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 General Introduction 1.2 Statement of the Problem 1.3 Objectives of the Research 1.4 Research Questions", " Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 General Introduction Phytoplankton are microscopic and free floating aquatic plants, which do not have ability to swim; their movement is supported by water currents (Bryceson 1977). Phytoplankton; the primary producers of organic matter in aquatic habitats, are equivalent to plants on land (Lugomela 1996). Phytoplankton constitute about 95% of the total marine primary production (Lugomela 1996), and serve as the basis for many food webs in the aquatic environment. They are the basis for food for primary consumers such as zooplankton. Secondary and tertiary consumers also feed on these organisms during their larval stage of development (Karlson, Cusack, and Bresnan 2010). Some phytoplankton species especially those belonging to the cyanobacteria such as Richelia spp, Nostoc spp, and Trichodesmium spp are able to fix free nitrogen and hence enrich marine environment with nitrogenous nutrients (Bryceson 1977; Lugomela, Wallberg, and Nielsen 2001). McClanahan (1988) noted that, nitrogen fixation is among the major source of nitrogen in the near shore waters of Tanzania, and it is highest during the northeast monsoon season when there is minimum mixing of the water column. Under high nutrients concentration, phytoplankton like other microalgae may proliferate to high biomass forming algal blooms commonly known as red tides (Lugomela, 2005). Some phytoplankton species such as Dinophysis spp may cause serious problems even at moderate biomass levels (Devassy 1989). In most cases red tides have been associated with negative effects, causing severe economic losses to aquaculture, fisheries and tourism operations and having major impacts on environment and human health. Phytoplankton growth is dependent upon solar radiation and nutrient substances. Phytoplankton is essential for other marine life because it is the basis of the food chain (Vargas, Escribano, and Poulet 2006). Robinson (2004) explained that growth of phytoplankton need carbon dioxide (CO_2_), which absorbed from atmosphere in the seawater. Phytoplankton are also important in ocean carbon cycle; they carry out photosynthesis, which consumes carbon dioxide (Street and Paytan 2005). The ocean carbon cycle is highly related to the greenhouse effect and climate change. On a global scale, phytoplankton has important role in earth carbon cycle because it process one billion tonnes of carbon per year (Honjo 1997). This process of utilizing free carbon dioxide in the water by the marine plants to form organic carbon compounds is called primary production. Photosynthesis in phytoplankton as is in terrestrial vegetation is dependent upon capturing light energy using chlorophyll pigments and in particular chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). The Chl-a absorbs sunlight energy usefully in converting it to sugar during photosynthesis (Raymont, 1980). In aquatic environments, Chl-a concentration is an indicator of phytoplankton abundance and biomass. They can be an effective measure of trophic status and are potential indicator of maximum photosynthetic rate (P-max). Abundance and biomass of phytoplankton, as determined via Chl-a concentration is important for several planning and management activities of the coastal waters of the earth (Lillesand and Kiefer 1994; Smits, Dellepiane, and Schowengerdt 1999) because it constitutes key environmental information for many scientific, resource management and policy purposes, as well as for a range of human activities. The accurate knowledge of distribution and biomass of phytoplankton as Chl-a, represents the foundation for coastal water classification and management (Dai and Khorram, 1998). Therefore a wide range of scientists and practitioners, including earth observation scientists, fisheries and water managers as well as urban planners seek information on the location, distribution and abundance of Chl-a concentration (Malone et al. 1988). Past studies on phytoplankton that have been conducted in Tanzania waters dealt with in situ determination of biomass and abundance of phytoplankton as well as primary production (Lugomela 1996; Bryceson 1977; Kyewalyanga 2002). Other studies examined the photosynthesis-Irradiance (P-I) curve for Trichodesmium spp (Lugomela 1996), based on oxygen evolution method, whilst other studies conducted in Zanzibar waters showed interaction between phytoplankton and other aquatic ecosystems (Kyewalyanga 2005). The in situ measurement of phytoplankton primary production using 14C has also been conducted in Zanzibar waters (Kyewalyanga 2002). In most of the previous studies, assessment and identification of phytoplankton distribution at specific areas along the coast of Tanzania waters were dominantly based on the in situ data collection. Although in situ data measurements could be of very high quality, synoptic coverage of the distribution of phytoplankton is not generally achieved. Conversely, Satellite ocean colour data provides large-scale and repetitive coverage sampling of global ocean Chl-a that are necessary to provide better understanding of the role of phytoplankton in biogeochemical cycling, climate change, and fisheries (Gregg and Conkright 2001). However, ocean colour data are subjected to several sources of error that affect their accuracy. The sources of error in satellite derived data may be associated with calibration, atmospheric correction, algorithm errors and problems in deriving Chl-a from radiances. Conventional, in situ methods typically provide an acceptable quality and accurate data but can only produce extremely limited spatial observation because of the expenses of sea operations and the large areal extent of the ocean. Thus a combination of the two data sources can maximize the strengths of each data set and produce a high-quality, spatially large data set of ocean Chl-a concentration. In view of the above, the present study used both in situ measurements and satellite derived ocean colour data for spatial and temporal determination of phytoplankton distribution and abundance in relation to other physico-chemical variables. 1.2 Statement of the Problem In marine environment, Chl-a, which is at the base of all food webs, has been used as a proxy indicator of the existence of phytoplankton (Babin et al., 1996). The spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of phytoplankton is important for aquatic ecosystems, particularly, the fisheries sector. In Tanzania there are limited studies on temporal and spatial distribution and abundance of phytoplankton. Outstanding studies include the study of Bryceson (1977) dealt with the ecology of phytoplankton in Dar es Salaam and that of (Lugomela 1996) that dealt with the taxonomy as well as the seasonal and spatial abundance of phytoplankton in Zanzibar near shore waters. Due to limited information on the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton, it is costly for fishers in terms of time and money, to locate fishing. Also fisheries managers and policy makers fail to develop good management strategies and policies due to unreliable and lack of timely information on the location of potential fishing grounds. Knowing the spatial and temporal abundance of phytoplankton will help fishers and fisheries managers to identify locations of high fish catch and their seasonal variation. This in turn will assist policy and decision makers on formulating policies for management of the marine fisheries in Tanzania. Historically, phytoplankton biomass has been determined using in situ method which has been shown to produce high quality data of phytoplankton biomass, but with limited details on temporal and spatial variability (Babin, Morel, and Gentili 1996a). The use of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) has recently proved to be an effective and efficient technique for studying phytoplankton in coastal and marine environment (Frouin, Schwindling, and Deschamps 1996). Despite the usefulness of this approach (due to its repetitive coverage of the satellites) at short time intervals (Frouin, Schwindling, and Deschamps 1996), its application on the coastal and marine waters of Tanzania is very scant. Thus, to try to narrow this gap, the present study applied both in situ collected and remotely-sensed satellite data to determine distribution and abundance of phytoplankton along the Pemba and Zanzibar channels. 1.3 Objectives of the Research The main objective of the present study was to determine the spatial and temporal variation of phytoplankton distribution and abundance in relation to other physico-chemical variables using remotely sensed satellite and in situ data along Zanzibar and Pemba channels. 1.3.1 Specific Objectives The specific objectives of the study were to; Determine temporal and spatial variation of phytoplankton distribution and abundance using satellite and in situ chlorophyll-a concentration. Examine the influence of physico-chemical variables (SST, nitrate, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, salinity and pH) on the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton. Compare the chlorophyll-a concentration between satellite delivered and in situ collected data. 1.4 Research Questions This study tried to answer the following questions: Is there any significant temporal and spatial variation of phytoplankton distribution and abundance in the investigated study sites? What is the influence of physico-chemical variables on the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton? + What is the relationship between satellite chlorophyll-a measurements and in situ chlorophyll-a concentration?

Variation in the concentration of these pigments in the water column is mainly caused by the abundance of phytoplankton in the water column (Yoder et al. 2001). 2.1 Estimation of Phytoplankton Biomass From Space Phytoplankton can be detected by satellite sensors because their photosynthetic pigment (Chl-a) absorbs blue, violet and red light and reflects green (Joint and Groom, 2000). Light from the sun enters the water and interacts (part of it being either scattered, absorbed or reflected) with the water itself or other water constituents such as suspended or dissolved matter [Robinson (2004). The fraction of light which is reflected back to the sensor is the one being used for remote sensing purposes. The measured radiance may be quantitatively related to various constituents in the water column that interact with visible light (Fett 2000). Colour change can be observed using a radiometer measuring the reflected light in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum between 400-700 nm wavelength; red (650 nm), green (520 nm) and blue (450 nm) (Robinson 2004). Light in the range 400-700 nm is known as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Satellite remote sensing of Chl-a concentrations rely on the absorption and scattering characteristics of phytoplankton and the way these optical properties affect the underwater light field and the reflectance or radiance values measured by the satellite sensor (Brando et al. 2006). Information on Chl-a concentrations is obtained using appropriate algorithms that relate measurements of remote sensing reflectance spectra either directly to Chl-a concentration (empirical algorithms), or to optical properties of phytoplankton and other optically active materials in the water using semi analytical algorithms or based on radiative transfer and theoretical relationships (Mansor et al. 2001). Satellite data can be used to characterize the habitat and ecosystem properties that influence marine resources at large, temporal and spatial scales, and high temporal and spatial resolution. There are two principal ways of using satellite data for fisheries management. The first is based on environmental monitoring; with a view to better understand ecosystem processes or stock biology (Solanki et al. 2003). The other is based on locating fish populations with a view to increase fishing efficiency or enhances conservation by mitigating human interactions (Solanki et al. 2003). Additionally, satellite data are used to monitor a number of issues that impact fisheries, such as harmful algal blooms and coastal pollution (Solanki et al. 2003). Satellite chlorophyll-a measurements are the primary or principal components of the algorithms used to calculate the primary productivity (PP) of the ocean (Pauly and Christensen 1995). Global PP measurements, in conjunction with fish catch statistics and food web models, can be used to estimate the carrying capacity of the world’s fisheries (Pauly and Christensen 1995). In the open ocean, 2% of the PP is needed to support the fishery catch. However in coastal regions, the requirement ranges from 24-35%, suggesting that these systems are at or beyond their carrying capacity (Pauly and Christensen 1995). The exhaustive capacity of coastal waters to support fishery is among the major issues of concern for fishery management as the bulk of the world’s fish catch comes from coastal areas. In other studies, discrepancies between the values of satellite derived PP and reported fish catches have been used to demonstrate spurious trends in global fish catches (Watson and Pauly 2001). Thus, satellite Chl-a data provides important objective baseline information which could be used to manage coastal and marine socio-economic activities. 2.2 The History of Satellite Ocean Colour The earliest sensor that has been used for mapping and measuring Chl-a concentration was Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) (Babin, Morel, and Gentili 1996b). Realizing the importance of synoptic global observation of marine parameters, several ocean colour sensors were then launched; Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWIFS) in July 1997; Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS Terra) in December 1999 and MODIS Aqua in May 2002 (Babin, Morel, and Gentili 1996b). The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectro-meter (MERIS) was launched by Europe and it started to operate in March 2002. The MODIS sensor is described in detail below since the data from this sensor was used in this thesis. 2.3 Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Aqua/Terra The MODIS sensors are placed on NASA’s EOS Terra and Aqua satellites. The sensor yields simultaneous observations of high atmospheric, oceanic (Sea Surface Temperature and chlorophyll) and land surface features (Barnes, Pagano, and Salomonson 1998). MODIS is placed in a 705 km sun-synchronous orbit. The temporal resolution is 1-2 days and has a field of view of \\(\\pm\\) 55º off-nadir, which provides a swath width of 2330 km. MODIS is a whiskbroom scanning imaging radiometer consisting of a cross-tracking scan mirror, collecting optics, and a set of linear array of detector with spectral interference filters located in four planes. The sensor collects data in 36 spectral bands and provides a spatial resolution from 250 × 250 m (bands 1 and 2) to 500 × 500 m (bands 3 through 7) and 1 × 1 km (bands 8 through 36) (Barnes, Pagano, and Salomonson 1998). 2.4 Spatial and Temporal Variation of Phytoplankton Biomass Phytoplankton biomass and composition varies with space and time (Raymont 1980). In temperate zones, phytoplankton biomass is characterized by high biomass and predominance of few species (Lugomela 1996). In contrast, the phytoplankton biomass in tropical areas is characterized by low biomass and a relatively higher richness of species. Phytoplankton biomass and productivity are also highly variable on short time scales as a result of short term fluctuations in the water column stability (Raymont 1980). These are generated by physical processes which affect the progression of seasonal conditions. Phytoplankton biomass in the coastal waters of Tanzania is generally high during the southeast (SE) monsoon season, particularly when it is raining and low during the northeast (NE) monsoon season, particularly when it is dry (McClanahan 1988). The higher concentration during the SE monsoon season is mainly attributed to relatively stronger mixing of the water column, greater runoff and nutrient input from rivers and greater availability of biologically assimilable nitrogen. Consequently, the total fish catch and reproduction rate are highest during this period (McClanahan 1988). 2.5 Factors Affecting Phytoplankton Variations There are several environmental (physico-chemical) variables which influence the distribution pattern of phytoplankton (Raymont 1980). The chemical variables include nutrients (nitrates, phosphate, silicates), salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO). The physical variables include temperature, water circulation, turbidity and light. In addition to these, biological factors such as grazing, competition and diseases also influence the distribution of phytoplankton (Lugomela 1996). Moreover there are three major environmental variables that control photosynthesis in water bodies, which include light, temperature and nutrient availability (Peterson et al. 1987), and there is a general correlation between the nutrient status of a body of water and its primary productivity (Riley and Prepas 1985). 2.5.1 Nutrients Availability of nutrient in the water column is one of the major environmental factors limiting phytoplankton abundance in the ocean. Although a wide range of chemical elements are required by the phytoplankton, nitrogen and phosphorus are the most critical elements as they are needed in quite large amounts, but are generally present in low concentrations in sea water (Kitheka et al. 1996). Several studies show a limiting effect of phosphorus for phytoplankton growth in temperate lakes and reservoirs but in most tropical regions, nitrogen is reported to be among the most critical nutrient element needed for phytoplankton growth (Hupfer and Lewandowski 2008). Generally, inorganic nitrogen is a limiting nutrient in the oceans while inorganic phosphorus limits phytoplankton growth in freshwater environments (Kitheka et al. 1996). Nutrient levels are also higher than normal along the coast for tropical seawaters indicating anthropogenic inputs. Concentration values ranging from 3.75 to 15.17 µg/l PO_43-, 26 µg/l NH4+ and 1.3 to 7 µg/l NO3- have been reported (Mohammed, Ngusaru, and Mwaipopo 1993). Conversely, Kyewalyanga (2002) found a relatively higher phytoplankton biomass of about 12.14 mgm^3 at Chwaka bay Zanzibar. In aquatic environment along the tropics, phytoplankton biomass is generally higher during the rainy season of SE monsoon. Higher productivity in this season is mainly attributed by greater runoff and nutrient input from rivers and availability of biologically assimilable nitrogen (Wang et al., 2006). 2.5.2 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Sea surface temperature (SST) is a very important environmental parameter for phytoplankton growth. The phytoplankton thrives only when the sea water is within the optimum temperature ranges (McClanahan 1988). The mixing processes in the ocean are generally influenced by the temperature conditions of the sea surface water. When surface waters are cold, it is easier for deeper water to rise to the surface, bringing nutrients to sunlit areas where phytoplankton can use them (McClanahan 1988). When surface water is warm, cooler, nutrient-rich water is trapped below. Because the vertical layers of the ocean are not mixing, nutrients that have built up in deep waters cannot reach the surface. In places where ocean currents cause upwelling, SST is often cooler than nearby waters, and Chl-a concentration is higher. In coastal upwelling areas, the rising slope of the sea floor pushes cold water from the lowest layers of the ocean to the surface. The rising, or upwelling water carries iron and other nutrients from the ocean floor (McClanahan 1988). Cold coastal upwelling and subsequent phytoplankton growth are most evident along the west coasts of North and South America and Southern Africa (Raymont 1980). Temperature of tropical sea depends on the weather conditions such as rainfall, relative humidity, air temperature, wind velocity and light radiation intensity. Sea surface temperature follows an annual cycle and is greatly influenced by the monsoon winds. Several studies (Lugomela 1996, Bryceson (1977); Julius 2005; Newell 1959) showed higher SST in the coastal waters of East Africa within the latitudes 0 - 10° S during the NE monsoon season and lowest during the SE monsoon season and exhibits seasonality that is influenced by changes in the water masses and by climate related factors. The differences in temperature during the different monsoon seasons are caused by the South Equatorial Current which brings water of relatively low temperature from the Pacific Ocean during the southeast monsoon and draws in waters of high temperature during the northeast monsoon (Francis, Shigala, and Aledaide 2001). Wang et al. (2006) indicated that, sea surface water temperatures between 20°C and 30°C are favourable for the growth of the phytoplankton. The SST within Zanzibar and Pemba channels reach a minimum of 25°C in September and rises to a maximum of 29°C in March (McClanahan 1988). This indicates that phytoplankton production and growth is favoured throughout the year within this region given that other environmental variables are constant. 2.5.3 Salinity Salinity is the mass fraction of salts in seawater (Fofonoff 1985). Salinity used to be expressed in parts per thousand. In practical terms, salinity is expressed as PSU (practical salinity units) which are based on water temperature and conductivity measurements (Fofonoff 1985). For oceanic seawater, ppt and PSU are very close. However PSU is unit-less, thus salinity now days has no unit. In general, salinity values around Tanzanian waters are relatively low during April and May, following the peak in freshwater outflow, and highest in November. The salinity values start to decrease in February before the beginning of the rains (Nyandwi and Dubi 2001). Lowest salinities occur at the onset of the southeast monsoon when the river discharges, cloud cover and rainfall are high. Immediately following the rainy season, salinity can drop drastically in near shore areas and some studies had indicated measurements as low as 26 (McClanahan 1988). The highest salinities occur during northeast monsoon when air temperatures and solar insolation are high and rainfall and discharge low (McClanahan 1988). In estuarine system salinity usually increases away from a freshwater source such as a river, although evaporation sometimes may cause the salinity at the head of the estuary to exceed that of seawater (Paula et al. 1998). The observed abnormality suggest that, rainfall is not the only driving force for salinity changes. The multiple factors that influence the sea surface salinity in near shore areas include surface runoff, dilution from rainfall and evaporation (Paula et al. 1998). 2.5.4 Dissolved Oxygen Dissolved oxygen (DO) refers concentration refers to the amount of oxygen contained in water, and defines the living conditions for oxygen-requiring (aerobic) aquatic organisms. Oxygen has limited solubility in water, usually ranging from 6 to 14 mgl-1^ (Connell, Miller, and Miller 1984). DO concentrations reflect the equilibrium between oxygen-producing processes such as photosynthesis and oxygen-consuming processes (aerobic respiration, nitrification, chemical oxidation), and the rates at which DO is added to and removed from the system by atmospheric exchange (aeration and degassing) and hydrodynamic processes (accrual/addition from rivers and tides against export to ocean) (Connell, Miller, and Miller 1984). Oxygen solubility varies inversely with salinity, water temperature and atmospheric and hydrostatic pressure. Dissolved oxygen consumption and production are influenced by plant and algal biomass, light intensity and water temperature (because they influence photosynthesis), and are subject to diurnal and seasonal variation (Connell, Miller, and Miller 1984). DO concentrations naturally vary over a twenty-four hour period due to tidal exchange, and net production of oxygen by plants and algae during the daytime when photosynthesis occurs. Coastal discharges of wastes rich in organic carbon (from sewage treatment plants, paper manufacturing, food processing and other industries) are produced in large quantities in urban population centers, and can substantially reduce dissolved oxygen concentrations (Connell, Miller, and Miller 1984). Most aquatic organisms require oxygen in specified threshold values for respiration and efficient metabolism, and if DO is not within the threshold conditions adverse physiological effects may occur (Best, Wither, and Coates 2007). Even short-lived anoxic and hypoxic events can cause major mortality of aquatic organisms. Exposure to low oxygen concentrations can have an immune suppression effect on fish which can elevate their susceptibility to diseases for several years (Mellergaard and Nielsen 1988). Moreover, the toxicity of many toxicants (lead, zinc, copper, cyanide, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and pentachlorophenol) can double when DO is reduced from 10 to 5 mgl-1 (Best, Wither, and Coates 2007). The death of immobile organisms and avoidance of low-oxygen conditions by mobile organisms can also cause changes in the structure and diversity of aquatic communities. Furthermore, if dissolved oxygen becomes depleted in bottom waters (or sediment), nitrification and therefore denitrification may be terminated, and bioavailable orthophosphate and ammonium may be released from the sediment to the water column. These recycled nutrients can give rise to or reinforce algal blooms. Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide gas (also the result of anaerobic respiration), can be toxic to benthic organisms and fish assemblages in high concentrations (Connell, Miller, and Miller 1984). In Tanzanian water, dissolved oxygen concentration approaches saturation throughout the year in the surface water but with some reduction in oxygen tension before the thermocline is reached (Wagner, 2002). The dissolved oxygen concentration in the coastal waters of Tanzania has been reported to range between 2-7 mgl-1 (Bryceson 1982). 2.5.5 pH The pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity of water on a logarithmic scale, varying from 0 (extremely acidic) through 7 (neutral) to 14 (extremely alkaline). It is the negative base-10 logarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) activity in moles per liter. Hydrogen ions predominate in waters with pH less than 7; hydroxyl ions (OH-) predominate in waters with pH greater than 7. The pH of marine waters ranges from 7.5 to 8.5 whereas most natural freshwaters have pH values ranging from 6.5 to 8.0 (Sotthewes 2008). Most waters have some capacity to resist pH change through the effects of the carbonate-buffer system (Chen and Durbin 1994). In this system, hydroxyl ions produced during the hydrolysis of bicarbonate neutralize H^+ ions, and maintain pH at a near constant level (Sotthewes 2008). Bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) are acquired from the weathering of silicate or carbonate minerals as rainwater passes through the soil zone. Some studies have demonstrated that pH also changes significantly in marine systems despite the strong buffering capacity of the carbonate system in seawater (Frithsen et al., 1985, Pegler and Kempe, 1988). This may be an important factor regulating algal abundance and distribution in many marine systems. Generally, changes in pH levels in marine systems appear to correlate with changes in temperature, dissolved oxygen, and phytoplankton production. Conditions of high pH, high phytoplankton production, and high oxygen conditions are characteristic of nutrient enriched systems and often are found in coastal waters or enclosed bodies of water (lagoons, salt ponds and embayments) which receive anthropogenic inputs such as sewage effluent or agricultural runoff (Park, Hood, and Odum 1958; King 1970; Oviatt et al. 1986). In these systems, pH ranges approaching 9 have been measured. The pH levels exceeding 9.0 have been recorded in a number of coastal marine systems (Hires, Stroup, and Seitz 1963; Emery 1972; Frithsen, Keller, and Pilson 1985) References "],
["methods.html", "Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Description of the Study Areas 3.2 Sampling Design 3.3 Data Collection Types and Techniques 3.4 Data Analysis", " Chapter 3 Methods 3.1 Description of the Study Areas The research was carried out in two selected sites within Pemba (Figure 3.1) and Zanzibar channels (Figure 3.2). The Zanzibar channel site was chosen so as to determine the influence of sewage effluent (human activities) on the phytoplankton. The Pemba channel site was selected in order to determine the influence of fresh water on the distribution and abundance of the phytoplankton. The easy accessibility of laboratory facilities at the Pangani IMS centre was the other factor for the selection of the Pemba channel site. The Pemba channel which is about 700-800 m deep (Shaghude and Wannäs, 1998) and approximately 100 km long and 50 km wide (Rödder et al., 2010) separates the Tanzania mainland from the Pemba Island (Figure 3.1). The Pemba channel is considered to be part of the ancient Pangani river delta which was later down-faulted to form the deep channel between Tanzania mainland and the Pemba Island (Shaghude, 2001) while the northern most part of this channel faces the coast of Kenya. Figure 3.1: Map of Pemba channel showing the sampling stations along three transects The Zanzibar channel (Figure 3.2), located south of Pemba channel, separates the island of Unguja and Tanzania mainland. The channel is relatively shallow (less than 50 m depth) and it is approximately about 120 km long and 35 km wide (Shaghude and Wannäs, 2000). The Zanzibar channel is considered to be part of the ancient Ruvu River delta (Shaghude and Wannäs, 1998). Figure 3.2: Map of Zanzibar channel showing the sampling stations along three transects The climate within Zanzibar and Pemba channels is subjected to two alternating and distinctive seasons, the northern and southern monsoons, which have a marked effect on air and water temperature, winds and rainfall. Winds are a particularly important feature of the western Indian Ocean, driving the water circulation and affecting wave action, local climate, biological processes and human activities (Richmond, 2011). During the months of November to March, the prevailing trade winds are the NE monsoon winds. The NE monsoon wind is usually steady and light, about 5 ms-1. It is usually associated with short rainy periods and the true rainy season begins after the NE monsoon, from March to June. From June to September, the area experience a complete reversal in wind direction, a feature unique to the Indian Ocean, and the SE monsoon wind prevail. This period is characterized by relatively strong winds, reaching an average velocity of 9 ms-1. Air temperature at sea level rarely falls below 20oC and sea water temperature usually reaches a minimum of 25oC in September and rises to a maximum of 29oC in March (McClanahan, 1988). 3.2 Sampling Design Field data collection was conducted during both the dry season (January and February) and the rainy season (April). Sampling of physical, chemical and biological parameters was done once in each season for every site, making a total of two sampling campaigns for each study site. At the Zanzibar channel site, three cross-shore transects (proximal to the Zanzibar Town) with spatial separation of about 4 km (Figure 3.2) were chosen. Each transect was approximately 10 km long, and with ten sampling stations separated by approximately 1 km. At the Pemba channel site, the sampling transects were all designed to start from the Pangani river mouth (Figure 3.1). Two of the three transect (Transect 2 and Transect 3) were running either north-easterly or south-easterly to allow assessment of the influence of monsoonal variability. Transect 3 was shorter than transect 1 and 2 due to roughness of the ocean which leads to instability of the boat as a result drifting of the boat backward. 3.3 Data Collection Types and Techniques Two types of data were collected, the primary described in section 3.3.1 and secondary data expanded in section 3.3.2. 3.3.1 In situ Data The in situ data collected included SST, pH, salinity, and DO. These data were acquired using different measuring devices. The SST and pH measurements were acquired using a pH meter. The salinity measurements were obtained using a hand-held refractometer and DO was measured using a DO meter. Water samples for determination of Chl-a concentration and nutrients (nitrates and phosphate) were collected from the surface using one and half litre water bottles. 3.3.1.1 Geographical Location of Sampling Stations During the dry season, locations of the sampling stations were recorded using a hand held Geographical Positioning System (GPS). In order to ensure that subsequent samples during the rainy season were collected on the same locations of the previous sampling stations, Samsung Galaxy Smartphone which was running using an Android Operating System (with Essential GPS) Apps was used. The file that contains thirty geographical locations at Pemba Channel (Figure 3.1) and Zanzibar Channel (Figure 3.2) was loaded into Essential GPS App as waypoints. With its high capability of navigation and ability to show cached Google Map offline as well as using data connection internet, navigation to the positions recorded in earlier field determined with Essential GPS App. During navigation to the sampling points along a given transect, the GPS in the smartphone was turned on and each sampling point (waypoint) was set as target in essential GPS App environment, which was later used to guide the boat for navigation towards the targeted sampling points. Because of the clear atmosphere and absence of obstacles in the oceanic water, targeted sampling station were located at an accuracy of about \\(\\pm\\) 2 meters. 3.3.1.2 Laboratory Analysis Water samples collected for Chl-a were taken into the laboratory and filtered through membrane filters (pore size 0.45μm). 500ml of water sample was used for filtration. Filters were folded in aluminium foil and stored in a Ziplok bag and kept in freezer for subsequent analysis. Due to lack of laboratory equipment for Chl-a determination at Pangani, the frozen filters were stored in icebox with ice inside and transported by air from Tanga to Zanzibar for subsequent analysis at the Institute of Marine Sciences laboratory. 3.3.1.2.1 Calibration of the Fluorometer Before Chl-a measurements, the fluorometer (Aquafluoro-turner Designs model 8000-010) was calibrated following the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) protocols (UNESCO, 1994). From the calibration process, the linear calibration factor \\(K_x\\) was calculated as the slope of non-acidified fluorometric reading versus Chl-a concentration of the standard calculated spetrophotometrically. The acidification coefficient \\(F_m\\) was also calculated by averaging the ratio of the non-acidified and acidified fluorometric readings \\(\\frac{F_o}{F_a}\\) of Chl-a dilutions of the standard. 3.3.1.2.2 Chlorophyll-a Extraction and Measurements Filters were placed in test tubes and 10ml of 90% acetone solution was added. These tubes were then covered with aluminium foil and kept in the refrigerator to allow for chlorophyll-a extraction. After two days, the test tubes were removed from the refrigerator and centrifuged at a speed of 3000 revolution per minute (rpm) for 10 minutes, and then put into the cuvette. A fluorometer was used to determine the reflectance value of Chl-a in the cuvette. The fluorometer reading before addition of acid in the sample was recorded (F0), to obtain corrected Chl-a, 2 drops of 10% HCl was added in the cuvette, a new fluorometer reading after addition of acid was recorded (Fa). The concentration of chlorophyll-a in the sample were then calculated using equation (3.1) described by Lorenzen (1966). \\[ \\begin{equation} \\phi = \\frac{F_m}{F_m - 1} \\times (F_o-F_a) \\times k_x \\times \\frac{vol_{ex}}{vol_{filt}} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation} \\] Where: \\(\\phi\\) = chlorophyll conentration \\(F_m\\) = acidification coefficient, average of (Fo/Fa) \\(F_o\\) = reading before acidification \\(F_a\\) = reading after acidification \\(K_x\\) = calibration coefficient \\(V_{ex}\\) = extraction volume \\(V_{filt}\\) = sample volume 3.3.1.2.2.1 Nutrient Determination A portion of filtered water was used to determine nutrient using a spectrophotometer (type UV-1601 Shimadzu). Nitrate concentration was determined using Parson et al., (1989) cadmium reduction method while phosphate levels were determined by the method of Murphy and Riley as described by Parson et al., (1989). 3.3.1.3 In situ Data Processing The in situ data obtained, were first processed before actual analysis. The methodology used in processing the data is described in the foregoing sections (section 3.3.1.3.1 and section 3.3.1.4): 3.3.1.3.1 Data Preparation The geographical locations of sampling stations for the Pemba and Zanzibar channel sites were downloaded as GPS standard format (Gpx) and converted to Text Delimited file (txt) using MapSource software version 6. The file was then imported into Microsoft excel spread sheet, where all other laboratory analysed data (chlorophyll-a concentration, nitrate and phosphate) and direct collected field data (DO, Salinity, pH and SST) were compiled with their respective sampling stations. An automated model (Figure 3), which loops a series of geo-processing operations was built using ESRI ModelBuilder by incorporating several geo-processing tools of ArcGIS Toolbox 10.1. Figure 3.3: The Model created to process in situ variables and creates surface datasets of physical, chemical and biological parameters. 3.3.1.4 Creation of Raster Surface Layer Datasets The Inverse distance weighting (IDW) method with a second order power was used to interpolate and create surface datasets of physical, chemical and biological parameters for each study site during the dry and rainy seasons. IDW is one of the most common methods of spatial interpolation; which estimates the value of an unknown location by averaging the values of nearby sample points (Watson and Philip, 1985). With this interpolation procedure the data points closer to the sampling points are considered to have higher weights than data points further away from the sampling points where the weights decrease exponentially as a function of distance from the sampling point (Figure 3.4). Figure 3.4: The Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) According to Watson and Philip (1985), the IDW is based on the interpolation principle which state: the closer a sample point is to the location being estimated, the more influence, or weight, it has on the estimate Philip (1985) The formula used to average the nearby sample points includes a weighting factor to account for spatial autocorrelation. The usual weighting factor is inverse distance squared (n=2). This means that a sample point’s influence decreases in proportion to the square of its distance from the estimated point. The simplest weighting function (w) is the inverse power of distance computed with equation (3.2) described by Watson and Philip (1985): \\[ \\begin{equation} w(d) = \\frac{1}{d^n} \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation} \\] 3.3.2 Satellite Data The satellite derived Chl-a data used in this study were obtained from Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (NEODAAS) server. The imageries were obtained from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) Aqua sensor. The imageries were georeferenced and stored as Network Common Data Form (NetCDF ) format. To study the seasonal and spatial variability of Chl-a within the study areas, monthly composite Chl-a imageries with a spatial resolution of 500 m for the period of January through December 2012 were used. The satellite SST data were obtained from Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI), which owns a GeonetCast ground receiving station. The station had been acquiring MODIS data since January 2012. As cloud cover obscured most of the daily SST composite imageries three day composite imageries for January through December 2012 with a spatial resolution of 1 km were found to be more suitable for the analysis. The three days composite SST imageries were therefore used in the present study in preference to the former imageries. The imageries were first georeferenced and then stored as Geographic Tagged Image File Format (GeoTIFF). In order to obtain monthly composite, the three day composite SST imageries for a given month were imported into the Quantum GIS (QGIS) software version 1.8.0 using Build Virtual Raster (Catalog) and these were then exported and saved in virtual format (vrt). The virtual format SST imageries for January through December 2012 were then imported into ArcGIS software where they were transformed and saved in TIFF format. Selected Chl-a imageries were imported into ArcGIS using Make NetCDF Raster Layer Tool. Both SST (TIFF) and Chl-a imageries were sampled to the study area using clip tool and the sampled imageries were then positioned on actual location on the earth surface using Geographic Coordinate System of World Geodetic System of 1984 (GCS WGS 84). Cloud cover obscured some of imageries making some cells not having the SST or Chl-a values. All cells which had no values were assigned as NoData and made transparent for the selected satellite imagery using image analysis window which contains specialized raster and image enhancement tools. 3.3.3 Extraction of Chlorophyll-a Concentration from Satellite Images Due to ArcGIS limitation in performing raster to raster correlation analysis, the monthly Chl-a concentration and SST from satellite imageries that falls within the in situ sampling stations were extracted and stored in feature class dataset. Since this scenario involved running the same sequences of tools for several images, a model was created to automate the process (Figure 3.5). Figure 3.5: A Geoprocessing model created to automate processed for extracting chlorophyll-a and SST data from satellite images The automation process allowed to avoid carrying out the same extraction process several times each month for Chl-a and SST. A model was constructed using Model Builder; an interactive program that allowed the users to chain tools together, using output of one tool as input in another. Explanation of some key stages of this model is described below: The NetCDF variable is a workspace folder containing selected satellite Chl-a imageries that were iterated while the TIFF variable is a workspace folder containing selected satellite SST imageries that were iterated. Each iteration produced a raster variable which was connected as input to the project raster tool, where the raster spheroid coordinate system was transformed from World Geographic System (WGS84) to a flat surface Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM Zone 37S). The Extract Multi Value To Points Tool was used to extract each satellite imageries Chl-a and SST values by spatial location. This tool extract SST and Chl-a concentration at locations of in situ sampling stations and records the values to the attribute table of the point feature class, which is also used as input in the model apart from the raster. The extracted Chl-a and SST values from satellite imageries were then collected by Collect Value Tool, which is designed to collect the output values of the iterator. Then the attribute table of sampling station point feature class, which contain both in situ and satellite Chl-a concentration and SST were exported and compiled into Excel spreadsheet. The extracted spatial data from spreadsheet was then imported into OriginPro statistical package for further analysis. 3.3.4 Comparison Between Satellite and in situ Chlorophyll-a Concentration Of all the stations where in situ data were collected, the stations that were on a cloud/haze-free pixel of satellite image were considered for the comparisons. To give a greater number of data points for correlation and to reduce uncertainty and noisy in statistical data analysis and also to matchup satellite data with the in situ Chl-a data, mean satellite Chl-a concentration for January, February, July, August, September, October, November and December were pooled together to represent the dry season where as the mean for March, April, May and June represented the rainy season. Satellite Chl-a concentration for rainy and dry seasons for the year 2012 were used for correlation with in situ Chl-a concentration using Pearson’s product moment correlation analysis. 3.4 Data Analysis Spatial and temporal distribution of chlorophyll-a at different time scales were investigated using ArcGIS Spatial Analyst Extension Version 10.1. All statistical analyses were performed using OriginPro statistical and graphic software version 8.6. Data were checked for normality and homogeneity of variances, and transformed where necessary. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (KWANOVA) test was used to determine the significant variation of chlorophyll-a and SST among months. Mann Whitney U-test was used to test for significant difference in chlorophyll-a concentration between dry and rainy seasons. The spatial and temporal variation of chlorophyll-a concentration between Pemba and Zanzibar channels, were analysed using Analysis of Variance (one way ANOVA), which was followed by post-hoc Bonferroni means comparison test. The variability of chlorophyll-a between transects within the study sites was also determined using one way ANOVA which was followed by post-hoc Bonferroni means comparison test. To ascertain the factors for spatial and temporal variation of phytoplankton at both sites, the physical-chemical variables were compared with chlorophyll-a concentration using Pearson’s product-moment correlation (r) and multiple linear regression analyses. The correlation between satellite and in situ chlorophyll-a concentration was also determined using Pearson’s product-moment correlation (r) analysis. "],

These seasons have different characteristics. The SE monsoon (March to October) has high cloud cover, dry, strong wind and decreased temperature and light (McClanahan 1988). This is contrast to NE characterised by low cloud cover, wet, weak wind, increased temperature and light. Figure 4.1 show the variation of chlrophyll across the study area and at two distinct monsoon winds. The dry period (SE monsoon) has relalatively higher chl-a (Figure 4.1b) than the wet period (NE monsoon) (Figure 4.1a). And the concentration of chlorophyll is higher in Zanzibar channel than in Pemba channel in dry season (Figure 4.1b) and wet season (Figure 4.1a). Figure 4.1: MODIS images showing Chlorophyll-a distribution for the Zanzibar and Pemba channels during a)rain and b)dry season The seasonal variation in figure 4.1 provide a snapshot of chlorophyll variation based on two monsoon influence. Figure 4.2 show the climatological monthly variation of Chl-a concentration in the study area. From November, the chl-a concentration decrease gradually until the maximum value in March and then began to increase and reaches its peak in August. Generally, the concentration of Chl-a had declined from November to April and a relatively high concentration during this period was restricted to a narrow strip along the coast (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Monthly climatology of chlorophyll-a concentration within the Pemba and Zanzibar Channels The chl-a from in-situ shows similar spatial pattern as that of satellite observation in the Pemba channel. Rain period (Figue 4.3a) has significant higher chlorophyll values than dry season (Figure 4.2b). The areas close to the Pangani River estuary have the highest concentration in both seasons (Figure 4.3a &amp; 4.3b). While in rainy season, the Pemba channel had highest values of Chl-a close to the Pangani river mouth (Figure 4.3), the dry season, there was a relatively low concentration to this area except around the river mouth and on the southern part of the Pangani river mouth (Figure 4.3 which was having a relatively higher Chl-a concentration. The concentration value of chlorophyll-a was signfificant higher in rain season than the dry season (Table 4.1). Figure 4.3: Spatial distribution pattern of in situ chlorophyll-a at the Pemba channel site (a) Rainy season (b) Dry season Table 4.1: Statistics of chlorophyll-a distribution pattern for the Zanzibar and Pemba channel sites during the dry and rainy seasons Site Season Critical value p value Pattern Significance Zanzibar Dry 0.05 0.09950 Random NS Zanzibar Rainy 0.05 0.00020 localized *** Pemba Rainy 0.05 0.00001 localized *** Pemba Dry 0.05 0.06000 localized NS However, the scale used in Figure 4.3a and 4.3b are different. When similar scale was used, the chlorphyll value at the surface for the dry season are vey low (Figure 4.4b). There was no any spatial pattern observed since the Chl-a concentration for the dry season at the Pemba channel was below 0.001. Figure 4.4: Spatial distribution pattern of in situ chlorophyll-a at the Pemba channel site in the same scale for (a) Rainy season (b) Dry season For the Zanzibar channel site highest Chl-a values were found along the coastline but and the dongue of highest value was found to the northern part study area during the rain (Figure 4.5a) and dry (Figure 4.5b). There was a significant decreasing chl-a concetration away from coastline during the rainy season (Table 4.1). Figure 4.5: Spatial distribution pattern of in situ chlorophyll-a at the Zanzibar channel site (a) Rainy season (b) Dry season 4.2 Temporal and Spatial Distribution of Sea Surface Temperature The results on temporal and spatial distribution of sea surface temperature (SST) for the Zanzibar and Pemba channels during dry and wet seasons are shown in figure 4.6. The rain period was relatively warmer (Figure 4.6a) compared with the dry season (Figure 4.6b). in both seasons, the Zanzibar Channel was warmer than the Pemba Channel (Figure 4.6) Figure 4.6: MODIS images showing Sea Surface Temperature distribution for the Zanzibar and Pemba channels during a)rain and b)dry season 4.3 Chlorophyll-a and Sea Surface Temperature Variation Figure 4.7 show climatological monthly mean variation of Chl-a and SST for the study area (Figure 3.1 &amp; 3.2) . SST and chl-a revealed a complete inverse relation. There was a decrease in Chl-a concentration from January to March when the SST increased, and the Chl-a concentration increased from April and May and at this time the SST decreased. There were a slightly decrease in Chl-a on June whilst the SST marginally decreased and the Chl-a decrease from September to December and during this period SST was very high. Figure 4.7: Monthly mean climatology of a) chlorophyll-a and b) sea surface temperature for Pemba and Zanzibar Channel The mean Chl-a concentration displayed a bimodal distribution with first peak on May and the second high peak in April-May and in July-August (Figure 4.8. Figure 4.8 is similar to figure 4.7, but combine the sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a value on the same plot and the inverse relation between sst and chl become apparent. The month with high SST experience low chl and viceversa. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (KWANOVA) test showed a significant difference in Chl-a over the twelve climatological months (H = 66.23, 11 d.f, p &lt; 0.05) and SST (H = 244.27, 11 d.f, p &lt; 0.05) variation among months. Figure 4.8: Monthly mean climatology of a) chlorophyll-a and b) sea surface temperature for Pemba and Zanzibar Channel The Pearson correlation between satellite SST and satellite Chl-a showed a strong inverse relation between satellite SST and Chl-a (Figure 4.9), which was significant (r = -0.70, p &lt; 0.05). Figure 4.9: Correlation between mean monthly satellite Sea Surface Temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration within the study area 4.3.1 Seasonal Variation of Chlorophyll-a Concentration The variation of Chl-a concentration in the study region was observed during the dry (SE monsoon) and the rainy (NE monsoon) seasons. Considering the in situ seasonal Chl-a variations between seasons at Zanzibar and Pemba channels, the concentration was relatively higher at both study sites during the rainy season, with an average Chl-a concentration of above 0.31 mgm-3 compared to dry season, in which the Chl-a concentration was observed to be below 0.06 mgm-3 (Figure 4.10. The results revealed that the variation of the in situ Chl-a concentration between seasons was significant (U= 19, 1d.f., p &lt; 0.05). Figure 4.10: The mean in situ chlorophyll-a concentration with standard error of the mean between Zanzibar and Pemba channel sites during the dry and rainy seasons Considering the Chl-a concentration between sites and among seasons, Zanzibar channel had slightly higher concentration compared to the Pemba channel site in both dry and rainy seasons (Figure 4.10, which was significant (F_{3, 116}_=16.96, p &lt; .05). This difference in Chl-a concentration between sites and among seasons was further analysed using Bonferroni means comparison test. It was observed that Chl-a concentration between different seasons and among different sites was statistically significant, except for between sites in the same season (Table 4.2) Table 4.2: The means comparison test of chlorophyll-a between seasons and among sites carried out using Post-hoc means comparison Site &amp; Season Site &amp; Season t-value p-value Significance Zanzibar Rainy Pemba Rainy 1.05182 1×100 NS Pemba Dry Pemba Rainy -4.46650 1.1×10-4 *** Pemba Dry Zanzibar Rainy -5.51830 1.3×10-6 *** Zanzibar Dry Pemba Rainy -4.45870 1.2×10-4 *** Zanzibar Dry Zanzibar Rainy -5.51050 1.3×10-6 *** Zanzibar Dry Pemba Dry 0.00784 1×100 NS 4.4 Variation of Between Transects Insitu chl-a concentration revealed considerable variation between seasons and among transects. At the Pemba channel, the values of Chl-a were relatively higher at transect 2 compared to transects 1 and 3 during the rainy season. The average Chl-a concentration for transect 2 was generally above 0.5 mgm-3, while the average Chl-a concentration for transects 1 and 3 was generally below 0.26 mg/m3 (Figure 4.11). During the dry season, the concentration of Chl-a was relatively very low at all the three transects (Figure 4.11a) compared with the wet season (Figure 4.11b). Figure 4.11: The mean and error of chlorophyll-a concentration and variation between transects within the study sites during a) dry season and b) wet season At the Zanzibar channel site during the rainy season, the concentration of Chl-a was relatively higher for transect 3, with a mean concentration of above 0.48 mgm-3 compared to transects 1 and 2 that were observed to have mean concentration below 0.36 mgm-3 (Figure 4.11). Similar to the Pemba channel site, the concentration of Chl-a at the Zanzibar site during the dry season, was relatively very low for all the three transects (Figure 4.11a). This variation in Chl-a concentration among transects showed a difference statistically at the Pemba channel site during the rainy season only and there was no significant difference in Chl-a concentration among transects during the dry season for the Pemba site and at the Zanzibar site in both seasons (Table 4.3).

During the rain seasone chlorophyll was positively related with phosphate, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and pH and negatively related with salinity and SST (Figure 4.12a). the influence of these variables vary with channel. While nitrate, and pH posivitely related with chlorophyll at Zanzibar channel, oxygen and phosphate have strong influence in the Pemba channel (Figure 4.12a). SST negatively infuenced chlorophyll during the rain season at Pemba channel and salinity affected chlorophyll negatively in Pemba and Zanzibar channel (Figure 4.12a). Like the rain season, the same environmental variables influenced chlorophyll concentration but in the reversed order (Figure 4.12b). Except for SST, that influenced chlorophyll negatively during the dry season, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, pH, and salinity showed a positive influence with chlorophyll (Figure 4.12b) Figure 4.12: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the infulence of environmental variables on chlorophyll in Pemba and Zanzibar channels during the a) rain and b) dry seasons The results revealed that, during the dry season, nitrate, phosphate and DO were positively and significantly correlated with the Chl-a, suggesting that the increase in these physico-chemical variables favoured phytoplankton biomass and abundance. Salinity was negatively and significantly correlated with Chl-a concentration, indicating that the increase in this variable tends to decrease Chl-a concentration (Table 4.9). The pH and SST showed a weak relationship with Chl-a (Table 4.9). Table 4.9: Correlation analysis between chlorophyll-a and physico-chemical variables during the dry season Dependent variable Independent variables Correlation coefficient (r) p value Significance Chl-a Nitrate 0.60 4.37 × 10-7 *** Chl-a Phosphate 0.28 0.03 Chl-a SST -0.16 0.24 NS Chl-a DO 0.53 3.09 × 10-5 *** Chl-a Salinity -0.45 4.19 × 10-4 *** Chl-a pH 0.20 0.14000000000000001 NS The relative weights of each of the six physico-chemical variables during the dry season, were examined using a multiple linear regression model which produced R² = 0.36, F(6, 53) = 5.01, p &lt; 0.05 (Table 4.10). The results showed that nitrate, phosphate, DO and pH had significantly positive regression weights with Chl-a concentration indicating that, the increase in these variables were expected to increase Chl-a concentration, after controlling for other variables in the model. Therefore, the increase in one unit of nitrate, phosphate, pH and DO will increase Chl-a concentration by 1.33 × 10-5, 2.69 × 10-3, 9.20 × 10-4 and 7.93 × 10-5 units respectively (Table 10). The SST and salinity had significantly negative regression weights with Chl-a, indicating that the increase in these variables is expected to lower the value of Chl-a. Thus, the increase in one unit of SST will decrease Chl-a concentration by 5.58 × 10-5 units while the increase of one unit of salinity will decrease the concentration of Chl-a by 3.02 × 10-4 units (Table 4.10). Table 4.10: Results of multiple linear regression analysis between chlorophyll-a and the physico-chemical variables during the dry season.

However, the change in phosphate showed to have a stronger positive impact on Chl-a concentration in multiple regression analysis during this season. During the rainy season nitrate and DO were positively and significantly correlated with Chl-a (Table 4.11), indicating that the increase in these variables tends to increase the Chl-a concentration in this season. Phosphate and pH were also positively but not significantly correlated with Chl-a (Table 11). SST and salinity were negatively and significantly correlated with Chl-a concentration indicating that the increase in these variables tends to decrease the Chl-a concentration (Table 4.11).

Nitrate, phosphate and DO had significant positive regression weights (Table 4.12), indicating that the increase in these variables is also expected to increase the values of Chl-a concentration, after controlling for the other variables in the model. So, the increase of one unit of nitrate, phosphate, and DO will increase Chl-a concentration by 0.87, 0.80, and 0.07 units, respectively (Table 4.12). The SST, pH and salinity had a significantly negative weight indicating that variable with higher values were expected to lower Chl-a concentration. Thus, the increase of one unit of SST, pH and salinity will decrease Chl-a concentration by 0.02, 2.13 and 0.2 units, respectively (Table 4.12).

However, the change in pH showed to have stronger negative impact on Chl-a concentration in multiple regression analysis in this season. 4.7 Comparison Between Satellite and in situ Chlorophyll-a Concentration The extracted satellite and in situ Chl-a concentration were imported into OriginPro statistical software for further analysis. The descriptive statistics for the satellite and in situ Chl-a were calculated and the simple arithmetic values for the in situ and satellite Chl-a are summarized in Table 4.13. Table 4.13: Descriptive statistics summarizing simple arithmetic values for satellite and in situ chlorophyll-a concentration Statistics In situ Satellite N total 58.00 58.00 Mean 0.08 0.65 Standard Deviation 0.16 0.28 SE of mean 0.02 0.04 Minimum 0.00 0.23 Median 0.00 0.56 Maximum 0.77 1.69 The correlation between satellite and in situ Chl-a concentration showed a stronger relationship for both rainy and dry seasons (Figure 4.13). There was a stronger positive and significant correlation between satellite and in situ Chl-a during the rainy season (r = 0.86, p &lt; 0.05). During the dry season, the satellite Chl-a was also positively and significantly correlated with the in situ Chl-a though the relationship was marginally weaker than that of the rainy season (r = 0.74, p &lt; 0.05). However the satellite Chl-a concentration was observed to be much higher than the in situ Chl-a concentration for both seasons (Figure 4.13).

The results showed that the highest Chl-a concentration were observed during the month of April and August or during the rainy season than the dry season. The higher phytoplankton biomass in April and along the coast might be influenced by nutrients input from the land-based sources. During the rainy season (March through June), nutrients from land based sources are carried by the water to the ocean, and this would enrich the coastal waters and enhance productivity in these areas. Higher phytoplankton biomass in August could be due to low sea surface temperature during the SE monsoon season that favours phytoplankton production. Furthermore, the higher phytoplankton biomass during this season could be associated with water mixing caused by strong winds that characterize the SE monsoon season. Mixing would bring up deep nutrient-rich waters to the surface, thereby stimulating phytoplankton production. McClanahan (1988) found that, phytoplankton biomass in the coastal waters of Tanzania is high during the SE monsoon season; and is mainly attributed by greater mixing of the water column, greater runoff and nutrient input from rivers and greater availability of biologically assimilable nitrogen. There was a relatively higher phytoplankton biomass at the Zanzibar channel site than at the Pemba channel site (Figure 13). This might be attributed by high nitrate concentration in the Zanzibar channel (Tables 5 and 6) than for the Pemba channel site (Tables 7 and 8). The coast of Zanzibar channel receives sewage effluent from urban areas (Mohammed et al., 1993). Sewage is one of the rich nutrient sources to the ocean. Once in the ocean, the nutrients are utilized by the phytoplankton for photosynthesis to produce organic carbon into the ocean. The Pemba channel by contrast was associated with relatively low nutrient levels and this may attribute to the observed lower phytoplankton biomass on the Pemba channel. Suspended sediments and organic matter from the Pangani river at the Pemba channel site might also prevent light penetration for photosynthesis, thereby reducing phytoplankton production. This has been recorded as one of the major factors for the low productivity to many estuarine environments (Malone et al., 1988). In assessing whether there was difference in biomass of phytoplankton between transects, it was found that there was no significant difference in phytoplankton biomass between the three transects during the dry season at both Pemba and Zanzibar channel sites (Table 3). Contrary to the dry season, statistically, phytoplankton biomass during the rainy season was not significantly different at the Zanzibar channel site while at the Pemba channel site there was a significant difference in phytoplankton biomass between the three transects (Table 3), with higher biomass at transect 2 compared to transects 1 and 3. Higher biomass at transect 2 at the Pemba channel site during the rainy season might be due to high nitrate and phosphate concentrations and low SST for this transect. When surface waters are cold, it is easier for deeper water to rise to the surface, bringing nutrient into the surface to sunlit areas where it is utilized by phytoplankton for productivity (McClanahan, 1988). 5.2 Correlation Between Chlorophyll-a and the Physico-chemical Variables The Chl-a concentration obtained in this study was correlated with the physico-chemical variables and the results indicated that, nitrate and phosphate showed a positive relationship with Chl-a for both the dry and rainy seasons (Tables 9 and 11). However, nitrate showed a stronger relationship which was statistically significant compared to phosphate with a weak relationship. This might be due to the greater nitrogen requirement than phosphorus by the phytoplankton. Phytoplankton depend on nitrogen and phosphorus for making proteins, nucleic acids and other cell parts they need to survive, grow and reproduce. However they require 16 atoms of nitrogen, 1 atom of phosphorous and 106 atoms of carbon for making organic matter (Spokes, 2006). Results showed that the increase of 1unit of phosphate is expected to increase the concentration of Chl-a in greater amount than a unit of nitrate, during the dry season (Table 10). Phosphate by itself had smaller impact in the abundance of phytoplankton, but in the multiple regression model the impact of phosphate increased because of the relationship existing between phosphate and other variables in the model. However, lower nitrate and phosphate concentration was recorded during the rainy season when Chl-a concentration was higher. The lower nitrate and phosphate levels in the rainy season and the higher Chl-a concentration in this season is because; assimilable forms of nitrogen and phosphorus decrease simultaneously with the increase of phytoplankton biomass and the phytoplankton blooms had been recorded in the ocean when concentrations of phosphate and nitrate are at their lowest (Istvanovics et al., 1992). Sea surface temperature showed a negative relationship with in situ and satellite Chl-a concentration in both correlation (Tables 9 and 11) and multiple regression analysis (Tables 10 and 12) during the dry and rainy seasons. This might be due to the influence of sea surface temperature on mixing processes in the ocean. When surface waters are cold, it is easier for deeper water to rise to the surface, bringing nutrients to sunlit areas where phytoplankton can use them and increase their biomass (McClanahan, 1988). When surface water is warm, cooler nutrient-rich water is trapped below; since the vertical layers of the ocean are not mixing, nutrients that have built up in deep waters cannot reach the surface (McClanahan, 1988). The result of low nutrients at the surface leads to low phytoplankton biomass. Mansor et al., (2001) and Solanki et al., (1998, 2003) also obtained similar results that SST and Chl-a were negatively related and then they used this information to model the fish distribution. Dissolved oxygen showed a positive relationship with Chl-a concentration in both correlation and multiple regression analysis during dry and rainy seasons. Phytoplankton influence dissolved oxygen production and consumption (Connell et al., 1984). They produce oxygen during photosynthesis and this will increase DO concentration in the water column (Fukushima et al., 2004). Low phytoplankton biomass causes low oxygen production, hence low oxygen concentration into the ocean. Salinity also showed a negative relationship with Chl-a concentration in both correlation and multiple regression analysis. Thus, low salinity was recorded at areas with high Chl-a concentration while high salinity was recorded at areas with low Chl-a concentration. Salinity decreases as freshwater from the river and rainfall runoff enters the ocean or when evaporation decreases in the ocean. When fresh water input increases, it sweeps nutrient from the land to the ocean as a result oceanic salinity decreases. The nutrient will be used by the phytoplankton to increase their biomass. In the western Indian Ocean, salinity had been recorded to be low during the rainy season when rainfall and discharge are higher (McClanahan, 1988). Consequently, phytoplankton biomass at this region is generally higher during this season and lower in the dry season (Bryceson, 1977). In this study pH showed a positive correlation with Chl-a concentration in both dry and rainy seasons. Thus, low pH areas (acidic waters) were having low phytoplankton biomass while areas with high pH (alkaline waters) were having high phytoplankton biomass. The pH value is related to the concentration of phytoplankton biomass and abundance (Zhang et al., 2009). It is governed by the amount of carbon dioxide, which can react with water, as well as carbonate and bicarbonate to form complex but reversible carbonate systems (Wang et al., 2001). The carbon dioxide concentration is influenced by the phytoplankton, aquatic respiration, water temperature and oxidative decomposition of organic matter. Phytoplankton can transform carbon dioxide into organic matter and oxygen during photosynthesis, while aquatic respiration uses organic matter, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide (Zhang et al., 2009). High phytoplankton abundance leads to increase in photosynthetic activities which will increase carbon dioxide uptake from the ocean, resulting in increase of pH (Wetzel 1983; Welch 1992). By contrast, the increase in carbon dioxide produced by aquatic respiration process and the low phytoplankton abundance causes a decrease in pH (Wetzel 1983; Welch 1992). However, high pH levels may have an inhibitory effect on phytoplankton metabolism via the carbonate system. At high pH levels, the availability of CO2 decreases and may become limiting to photosynthesis and growth of the phytoplankton (Zhang et al., 2009). Also, the increase of CO2 give rise to ocean acidification and it is considered to have deleterious effects on calcifying organisms such as corals and some phytoplankton species such as the cocolithophorids. Some studies show that high acidic levels (low pH value) into the ocean cause calcium carbonate (which is the main skeletal material for many marine organisms as well as the phytoplankton) to dissolve (Pegler and Kempe, 1988). Therefore, pH mediated through CO2 may be an important abiotic factor affecting the ecology of marine phytoplankton. In the multiple linear regression analysis, pH was found to be negatively related with Chl-a during the rainy season (Table 12). By itself (in correlation analysis) pH is positively correlated with Chl-a, but in the multiple linear regression model the increase in pH values leads to decrease in Chl-a concentration due to the relationship that exist between pH and other variables in the model. 5.3 Comparison Between in situ and Satellite Chlorophyll-a Some of satellite images had no value due to cloud cover; this was a major challenge for matching up the satellite with the in situ data. The in situ measurement of surface Chl-a concentration was compared with ocean colour remote sensing images. The in situ Chl-a values varied between 0.001 and 0.770 mg/m3 with a mean value of 0.079 ± 0.021 mg/m3, whereas the mean Chl-a concentration of satellite images was 0.653 ± 0.037 mg/m3, with a maximum value of 1.691 mg/m3 (Table 17). These low values are typical of the oligotrophic waters as observed previously by other workers (Bryceson, 1977; Lugomela, 1996). In order to quantify the major differences between the satellite Chl-a data and in situ Chl-a measurements the two datasets were correlated. The satellite Chl-a concentration showed strong positive correlation with the in situ Chl-a measurements at Zanzibar and Pemba channels during both the dry and rainy seasons. Considering the in situ Chl-a distribution (Figure 7 and 9), the relative pattern was the same as that of satellite Chl-a (Figure 6), and this revealed that there was a similar spatial pattern of Chl-a concentration and coastal waters showed to have a relatively higher concentration, which tend to decrease toward the open waters. Although the results showed that in situ Chl-a concentration and those extracted from MODIS sensor are generally in agreement, satellite Chl-a consistently over-estimated the in situ Chl-a. Consistent over-estimation or under-estimation of Chl-a by MODIS sensor has also been reported by other workers (Joint and Groom, 2000; Doerffer and Schiller, 2007; Kampel et al., 2009). The discrepancy between the two datasets has often been attributed to either errors in the bio-optical algorithm performance, the satellite sensor calibration or in the atmospheric-correction algorithm (Joint and Groom, 2000; Doerffer and Schiller, 2007; Kampel et al., 2009). The other factor which could account for the observed higher satellite Chl-a derived data relative to the in situ Chl-a measurements may be the Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) discharged by the rivers on both Zanzibar and Pemba channels. CDOM like phytoplankton also absorb blue light strongly, leading to higher Chl-a concentrations detected by the sensor (Sathyendranath et al., 2001). The difference between the in situ and satellite datasets may also be due to the time difference during data collection between the satellite and in situ measurements. This could be particularly significant when the chlorophyll-a distribution features are dynamic. "],
["conclusion-and-recommendation.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion and Recommendation", " Chapter 6 Conclusion and Recommendation This study was conducted to determine the spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of phytoplankton in the Zanzibar and Pemba channels using both satellite and in situ Chl-a measurements. The results of the study revealed that, there was a spatial and temporal variation of phytoplankton distribution and abundance, with Zanzibar having relatively higher Chl-a concentration than the Pemba channel. The results of the present study revealed that Chl-a concentration at both Zanzibar and Pemba channels varied on seasonal basis with relatively higher concentration during the rainy season as compared to the dry season. The higher concentration of Chl-a during the rainy season was associated with the increased level of nutrients derived from the land based sources as most of the rainfall at both sites was received during this season. Analyses of the environmental variables which influenced the Chl-a concentration at the investigated sites revealed that during the dry season, the Chl-a concentration was mostly influenced by both nitrate and phosphate nutrients, but during the rainy season the Chl-a concentration was mostly influenced by nitrate and salinity. More than 50% of these variables accounted for the variation of Chl-a concentration. To the best of my knowledge, the present study was the first case study done in Tanzanian waters using the remotely sensed satellite Chl-a together with the in situ fluorometric Chl-a in the determination of the phytoplankton distribution and abundance. The results showed that, there was a strong positive correlation between satellite and in situ Chl-a concentration in both dry and rainy seasons. However the satellite tended to over-estimate the Chl-a values. This may be avoided by applying appropriate algorithm during the processing of the satellite data especially to coastal (Case II) waters; this will help to differentiate between the Chl-a and other water components such as CDOM and suspended sediments which might be the major factors for the higher Chl-a values. Employing the suggested algorithm will not only make it possible for distinguishing between Chl-a and other water components but also will make the process of cloud correction easier and improve the data quality (by reducing the number of cells with no data). Finally, future studies should consider employing higher spatial resolution remote sensing data (such as MERIS) than the one used in this study in order to have a better match up analysis between in situ and satellite and good spatial pattern of the phytoplankton at a given area. The in situ data collected for the Pemba channel site were done proximal to the Pangani estuary and no data of upstream the river were collected in this study due to financial and time limitation. More studies should be conducted to include the water of upstream to downstream the river in order to determine the phytoplankton variation at different water salinity. "],
